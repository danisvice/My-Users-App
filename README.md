## Task
TODO - What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
+ implement a MVC(Model View Controller) architecture

## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?
+ watched videos and tutorials on what and how MVC functions. 

## Installation
TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

## Usage

+ MVC(model view architecture) is the design schematic for the project. 
- model: handles the data requests and has direct interaction with the database, data validation, logic & persisence.
- view: presentation of informtion and interaction between the model and the controller, allowing for more complex projects.
- controller: data request handling & interacts with the model and the view. The controller never handles data direclty, only the requests.
- The user sends the data requests to the controller, the controller sends the requests to the model. The model pushes the data requests to the controller which then
  sends to the view. The controller is used as a middleman in order for separation of the view and model allowing for a more complex and interactive presentation for the user.
